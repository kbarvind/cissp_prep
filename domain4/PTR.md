Packet Acknowledgement:

- RST is used in TCP to reset a connection, 
- PSH is used to send data immediately, and 
- FIN is used to end a connection.

Windows systems will assign themselves an APIPA address between 169.254.0.1 and 169.254.255.254 if they cannot contact a DHCP server.

Organizations are most often concerned about hotspots creating an unsecured network connection into their secure network via laptops or other devices that are connected to them. Bridging a cellular connection to a network connection to the business's network creates a path that bypasses security controls.

Antenna placement, antenna design, and power level control are the three important factors in determining where a signal can be accessed and how usable it is. A captive portal can be used to control user logins, and antenna design is part of antenna types. The FCC does provide maximum broadcast power guidelines but does not require a minimum power level.

Cellular networks have the same issues that any public network does. Encryption requirements should match those that the organization selects for other public networks like hotels, conference WiFi, and similar scenarios. Encrypting all data is difficult and adds overhead, so it should not be the default answer unless the company specifically requires it.

Ed's best option is to install an IPv6 to IPv4 gateway that can translate traffic between the networks.

UDP is a simplex protocol at the Transport layer (layer 4 of the OSI model). Bits is associated with the Physical layer (layer 1). Logical addressing is associated with the Network layer (layer 3). Data reformatting is associated with the Presentation layer (layer 6).

The device in this scenario would benefit from the use of Zigbee. Zigbee is an IoT equipment communications concept that is based on Bluetooth. Zigbee has low power consumption and a low throughput rate, and it requires close proximity of devices. Zigbee communications are encrypted using a 128-bit symmetric algorithm.

Deduplication replaces multiple copies of a file with a pointer to one copy. If the one remaining file is damaged, then all of the linked copies are damaged or inaccessible as well. File encryption could be an issue, but the scenario mentions that groups of people work on projects and typically file encryption is employed by individuals, not by groups.

---

A screened subnet is a type of security zone that can be positioned so that it operates as a buffer network between the secured private network and the internet and can host publicly accessible services. A honeypot is a false network used to trap intruders; it isn't used to host public services. An extranet is for limited outside partner access, not public. An intranet is the private secured network.

# 🔐 Difference Between XDR and NGFW

Understanding how **XDR (Extended Detection and Response)** and **NGFW (Next-Generation Firewall)** differ is important in modern cybersecurity architecture. While both are security solutions, they serve different purposes and operate at different levels in the security stack.

---

## 📘 What is NGFW (Next-Generation Firewall)?

**NGFW** is a network security device that goes beyond traditional firewalls by providing:

- **Deep Packet Inspection**
- **Application-level filtering**
- **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**
- **Integration with identity and access controls**

### ✅ Key Features of NGFW:

- Stateful packet inspection
- Application awareness and control
- Web filtering
- Antivirus inspection
- IPS/IDS integration
- Encrypted traffic inspection (SSL/TLS)

---

## 📘 What is XDR (Extended Detection and Response)?

**XDR** is a **security operations** solution that integrates and correlates data across multiple security layers — including endpoint, network, server, email, and cloud — to detect and respond to threats more effectively.

### ✅ Key Features of XDR:

- Aggregates and correlates threat data from multiple sources
- Provides unified visibility and incident response
- Automates threat detection and containment
- Leverages AI/ML for threat hunting
- Integrates with EDR, NDR, SIEM, etc.

## 🧱 Comparison Table

| Feature                     | NGFW                                | XDR                                       |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Purpose                     | Network traffic filtering and control | Threat detection and response across layers |
| Level of Operation          | **Network perimeter**                | **Security operations layer**               |
| Visibility Scope            | Network and some application traffic | Endpoint, email, network, cloud, etc.       |
| Threat Detection            | Signature-based, rule-driven         | Behavior analytics, correlation, ML-based   |
| Prevention Capabilities     | Yes (blocks traffic, malware, etc.)  | No (detects and guides response)            |
| Response Capabilities       | Basic (block/drop)                   | Advanced (automated containment, response)  |
| Integration Scope           | Limited (mostly network-focused)     | Wide (integrates multiple security tools)   |
| Deployment Location         | Network edge                         | Security operations center (SOC)            |

---

## 🧠 Summary

- **NGFW** protects the **network perimeter** with advanced traffic filtering and intrusion prevention.
- **XDR** provides **cross-platform threat detection and response** by aggregating and analyzing data from diverse sources.
- Both can **coexist** — NGFW can feed data to an XDR platform for better correlation and visibility.

 - When transparency is a characteristic of a service, security control, or access mechanism, it is unseen by users. 
 - Invisibility is not the proper term for a security control that goes unnoticed by valid users. Invisibility is sometimes used to describe a feature of a rootkit, which attempts to hide itself and other files or processes. 
 - Diversion is a feature of a honeypot but not of a typical security control. 
 - Hiding in plain sight is not a security concept; it is a mistake on the part of the observer not to notice something that they should notice. This is not the same concept as camouflage, which is when an object or subject attempts to blend into the surroundings.

IEEE 802.1X provides port-based access control and is useful both on wired and wireless connections to block access to systems and users that are unknown or that fail authentication. It is a common companion to NAC implementations.

---

Enterprise extended infrastructure mode exists when a wireless network is designed to support a large physical environment through the use of a single SSID but numerous access points. An enterprise extension is often used as an extension to a wired network and requires only a single logon event for each connected session for workers no matter where in the building they are located.

- Store-and-forward switching receives and stores the entire frame in a buffer before forwarding, offering greater error checking and suitability for ensuring data integrity. 
- Arbitration is a media access protocol where a central authority or a predefined set of rules determines which device has the right to access the communication medium at any given time. It does not address integrity. 
- Cut-through switching forwards a frame as soon as it reads the destination address, providing low latency and suitability for low-latency applications. It does not address integrity.
- Deconfliction is a media access protocol that aims to avoid collisions and conflicts by assigning specific time slots or frequency bands to different devices for communication. It does not address integrity.

VDOMs are instances of firewalls, each with their own interfaces and rulesets allowing granular configurations based on security requirements. VDOMs are commonly used to accommodate different purposes, customers, or other needs where separately managed firewall instances are desirable
