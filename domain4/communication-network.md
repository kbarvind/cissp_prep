# 🧵 Cat 5 / Cat 6 Twisted Pair Cables

## 🧠 What is a Twisted Pair?

A **twisted pair** cable consists of pairs of insulated copper wires twisted together to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk between adjacent wires.

# 🛡️ Types of NAC (Network Access Control) Systems

Network Access Control (NAC) systems help enforce security policies on devices seeking access to a network. They inspect endpoints and grant, deny, or restrict access based on compliance.

---

# 🛡️ Deep Dive into NAC (Network Access Control)

## 📘 What is NAC?

**Network Access Control (NAC)** is a security solution that manages and controls access to a network based on predefined policies. NAC ensures that only authenticated, compliant, and trusted devices and users can connect to a network.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of NAC

- 🔐 Enforce **identity and device verification**.
- ⚙️ Control **what devices/users can access**.
- 🧪 Evaluate endpoint **compliance posture** (e.g., antivirus, OS version).
- 🚫 Quarantine or restrict **non-compliant** systems.
- 📊 Provide **visibility** into connected devices.

---

## 🧱 Core Components of NAC

| Component              | Function                                      |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Authentication**     | Verifies user or device identity (e.g., RADIUS, 802.1X). |
| **Policy Engine**      | Determines access based on defined rules.     |
| **Posture Assessment** | Checks device security status (e.g., antivirus up to date). |
| **Enforcement Point**  | Switch, router, or firewall that grants/blocks access. |
| **Remediation**        | Redirects non-compliant systems to a remediation network. |

---

## 🛠️ NAC Workflow

1. **Device attempts to connect** to the network.
2. NAC performs **identity/authentication** check.
3. **Posture assessment** is conducted (optional).
4. Access is either:
   - ✅ **Granted** (full or limited),
   - 🔒 **Denied**, or
   - 🔁 **Redirected** for **remediation**.
5. Continuous **monitoring** and **enforcement** post-admission.

---

## 🧩 Types of NAC

### 1. **In-Band (Inline) NAC**
- NAC device is in the **data path**.
- Monitors and enforces traffic in real time.
- Example: Forescout CounterACT.

### 2. **Out-of-Band NAC**
- NAC is **not inline**; uses control protocols (RADIUS, SNMP) to enforce policy.
- Common in **802.1X-based** architectures.
- Example: Cisco ISE, Aruba ClearPass.

---

## 🕵️ Pre-admission vs Post-admission NAC

| Type             | Description                           |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Pre-admission**| Checks device compliance **before** granting access. |
| **Post-admission**| Monitors behavior **after** access is granted.        |

---

## 🔐 Common Authentication Protocols Used

- **802.1X**: Port-based access control.
- **RADIUS**: Centralized authentication, authorization, accounting.
- **LDAP**: Directory-based user verification.
- **TACACS+**: Cisco’s alternative to RADIUS.

---

## 💡 Use Cases

- **Guest networking** with access restrictions.
- **BYOD** (Bring Your Own Device) control.
- **Contractor access** limitation.
- **IoT device** segmentation.
- **Endpoint compliance** enforcement.

---

## 🧪 Posture Checks Typically Include:

- OS type and version.
- Antivirus installation and update status.
- Patch level.
- Device type (e.g., mobile, laptop, IoT).
- Firewall status.

# 🌐 Peering in Networking

Peering refers to the **mutual agreement between two networks to exchange traffic directly**, without involving a third-party transit provider. It is a fundamental concept in the structure of the Internet.

---

## 🔍 What is Peering?

| Aspect       | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Definition** | A direct interconnection between two networks (usually ISPs, data centers, or cloud providers) to exchange traffic. |
| **Purpose**    | To optimize routing, reduce latency, and cut costs by avoiding intermediate (transit) networks. |
| **Where It's Used** | Internet backbone, cloud provider interconnects, CDN providers, IXPs (Internet Exchange Points) |

---

## 🔑 Types of Peering

| Type              | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Public Peering** | Networks connect via an **Internet Exchange Point (IXP)** where many networks meet. |
| **Private Peering** | A **dedicated direct connection** between two networks, typically via private lines. |
| **BGP Peering**     | Uses **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** to exchange routing information between networks. |

---

## 🆚 Peering vs Transit

| Feature      | **Peering**                             | **Transit**                             |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Cost**     | Often **free or settlement-free**       | **Paid service**                        |
| **Scope**    | Traffic between **peering partners only** | Traffic to **any destination on the Internet** |
| **Control**  | More direct control over traffic        | Less control, uses third-party routes   |
| **Latency**  | Lower                                   | Potentially higher                      |

---

## 📍 Example Scenarios

- **ISP Peering**: Two ISPs connect directly to avoid transit costs and improve performance.
- **Cloud Peering**: Cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud peer to provide fast cloud-to-cloud communication.
- **CDN Peering**: Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) peer with ISPs to serve content closer to users.

---

## ✅ Benefits of Peering

- 🚀 **Lower Latency** (fewer hops)
- 💰 **Reduced Bandwidth Costs**
- 🔄 **Better Redundancy and Routing Control**
- 📈 **Improved Network Performance and Reliability**

---

## 📘 Summary

Peering helps build a faster, more cost-effective, and resilient Internet. It is essential in large-scale networking and plays a key role in content delivery, cloud access, and ISP efficiency.
