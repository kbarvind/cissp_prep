# 🧵 Categories of Ethernet Cables

Ethernet cables are classified into different **categories (Cat)** based on their **speed**, **bandwidth**, and **shielding standards**. Here's a comparison of the most common types.

## 📊 Ethernet Cable Categories Comparison

| Category | Max Data Rate     | Max Bandwidth | Max Distance (100m) | Shielding | Use Case                         |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Cat 3    | 10 Mbps           | 16 MHz         | ✅                   | No        | Legacy telephone & 10BASE-T     |
| Cat 5    | 100 Mbps          | 100 MHz        | ✅                   | No        | 100BASE-TX (Fast Ethernet)      |
| Cat 5e   | 1 Gbps            | 100 MHz        | ✅                   | Optional  | Gigabit Ethernet (common today) |
| Cat 6    | 1 Gbps (10 Gbps*) | 250 MHz        | ✅ (10G up to 55m)   | Yes       | Modern LANs, data centers       |
| Cat 6a   | 10 Gbps           | 500 MHz        | ✅                   | Yes       | High-speed enterprise networks  |
| Cat 7    | 10 Gbps           | 600 MHz        | ✅                   | Yes (S/FTP) | Shielded, noise-sensitive areas |
| Cat 8    | 25-40 Gbps        | 2000 MHz       | Up to 30 meters      | Yes (S/FTP) | Data centers, short distance  |

## 🛡️ Shielding Types

- **UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)** – No shielding, more flexible, used in Cat 5e/Cat 6.
- **STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)** – Each pair or cable is shielded, reduces EMI.
- **FTP/SFTP** – Foiled Twisted Pair / Shielded and Foiled Twisted Pair, best for environments with high interference.
