# 🌐 Network Topologies

Network topology refers to the **arrangement of different elements (links, nodes, etc.)** in a computer network. It determines how data flows and how devices are connected.

---

## 📊 Types of Network Topologies

### 1. **Bus Topology**

- 🛣 All devices are connected to a **single central cable** (backbone).
- Data travels in **both directions** to reach the destination.

#### ✅ Advantages
- Easy to install for small networks.
- Requires less cable than other topologies.

#### ❌ Disadvantages
- Backbone failure = entire network down.
- Difficult to troubleshoot.
- Not scalable.

---

### 2. **Star Topology**

- 🌟 All devices connect to a **central hub or switch**.
- Data passes through the central device to reach others.

#### ✅ Advantages
- Easy to manage and expand.
- One device failure doesn't affect others.

#### ❌ Disadvantages
- Hub failure = entire network down.
- Requires more cable than bus topology.

---

### 3. **Ring Topology**

- 🔄 Each device connects to **two others**, forming a **closed loop**.
- Data travels in **one direction (unidirectional)** or both (dual ring).

#### ✅ Advantages
- Equal access for all devices.
- Predictable performance under load.

#### ❌ Disadvantages
- A single break can affect the entire ring.
- Troubleshooting is difficult.

---

### 4. **Mesh Topology**

# 🔄 CSMA/CD vs CSMA/CA

## 📘 What is CSMA?

**CSMA** stands for **Carrier Sense Multiple Access**. It is a **media access control** protocol used in networks to manage how devices share a common communication medium (like Ethernet or Wi-Fi).

Before sending data, each device **"listens"** to the network to check if the channel is free.

---

## ⚡ CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)

### ✅ Used In:
- **Wired Ethernet (especially older half-duplex networks)**

### 🧠 How it Works:
1. Device **listens** to the network.
2. If the channel is **idle**, it starts **transmitting** data.
3. If another device transmits at the same time, a **collision** occurs.
4. Collision is **detected** by measuring signal levels.
5. Devices **stop transmitting**, wait a **random backoff time**, and retry.

### 📉 Purpose:
To **detect** and **resolve collisions** during transmission on a shared medium.

### ❌ Limitations:
- Ineffective in wireless networks.
- Becomes inefficient as network traffic increases.

---

## 📡 CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)

### ✅ Used In:
- **Wireless networks (e.g., Wi-Fi / IEEE 802.11)**

### 🧠 How it Works:
1. Device **listens** to ensure the channel is **idle**.
2. Instead of sending data immediately, it sends a **Request to Send (RTS)**.
3. Receiver replies with a **Clear to Send (CTS)**.
4. Device waits a **random backoff** even after CTS, then transmits data.
5. Other devices **defer** transmission when they hear RTS/CTS.

### 📉 Purpose:
To **avoid collisions** in wireless networks where collision detection is **not feasible** due to signal interference and hidden node problems.

### ❌ Limitations:
- More **overhead** due to RTS/CTS handshakes.
- May reduce throughput in low-collision environments.

# 🚨 Network Topologies Vulnerable to Collisions

## 📘 What is a Collision?

A **collision** occurs when two or more devices attempt to send data on a shared network segment **at the same time**, causing the signals to interfere with each other.

---

## ⚠️ Most Vulnerable Topologies

### 1. **Bus Topology**

- **Highly vulnerable** to collisions.
- All devices share a **single communication channel** (the bus).
- No central device to manage traffic.
- More devices = higher chance of simultaneous transmissions.

### 2. **Ring Topology**

- Moderate collision risk in **unidirectional** rings.
- Data travels in one direction around the ring.
- If timing isn't managed properly, collisions can occur, though token passing (in token ring networks) is used to **minimize this risk**.

---

## ✅ Less Vulnerable Topologies

### 3. **Star Topology**

- **Low collision risk**, especially when using a **switch** (full-duplex communication).
- With a hub (older tech), collisions **can occur** because it behaves like a shared medium (like a bus).
- Switches isolate communication between devices, reducing collision domains.

### 4. **Mesh Topology**

- **Very low** chance of collisions.
- Devices are typically connected directly.
- Each link is dedicated — no shared medium.

### 5. **Tree Topology**

- Vulnerability depends on **components used**:
  - If switches are used → low collision risk.
  - If hubs are used → higher collision risk in shared branches.

### 6. **Hybrid Topology**

- Collision risk depends on the **combination** of topologies and devices.
- Example: star-bus hybrid will inherit bus topology’s collision potential if the central device is a hub.

|------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Bus        | 🔴 High              | Shared medium with no central control                |

| Mesh       | 🟢 Very Low          | Direct, dedicated links                              |
| Tree       | 🟢/🟠 Mixed           | Depends on whether switches or hubs are used         |
| Hybrid     | 🟢/🔴 Mixed           | Varies based on component topologies and devices     |

## ✅ Best Practices to Avoid Collisions

- Use **switches** instead of hubs.
- Segment the network into **smaller collision domains**.
- Upgrade to **full-duplex Ethernet**.
- Implement **CSMA/CD or CSMA/CA**, depending on the medium.

# 🔐 IPSec (Internet Protocol Security)

## 📘 What is IPSec?

**IPSec** is a **suite of protocols** designed to **secure Internet Protocol (IP) communications** by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet in a data stream. It operates at the **network layer** of the OSI model.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- Provides **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **authentication**.
- Works in **IPv4** and is **mandatory in IPv6**.
- Can be used in **VPNs**, securing traffic between networks, hosts, or devices.

---

## 🔐 Core IPSec Protocols

### 1. **Authentication Header (AH)**

- Provides **data integrity**, **origin authentication**, and **anti-replay**.
- Does **not encrypt** the data.

### 2. **Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)**

- Provides **data encryption**, **integrity**, **authentication**, and **anti-replay**.
- Can be used **with or without AH**.

---

## 🧱 Modes of Operation

### 🔁 Transport Mode

- Encrypts only the **payload** (data) of the IP packet.
- **Original IP header** is preserved.
- Used for **end-to-end communication** (e.g., host-to-host).

### 📦 Tunnel Mode

- Encrypts the **entire IP packet** and wraps it in a new IP header.
- Used for **network-to-network** or **host-to-network** communication (e.g., VPNs).
  
---

## 🔑 IPSec Key Management

- Uses the **Internet Key Exchange (IKE)** protocol to negotiate and manage keys:
  - **IKEv1** and **IKEv2** are common.
  - Establishes **Security Associations (SAs)** — agreements on how to secure the data.

---
