## ‚úÖ VPN Protocol Comparison Table

| Protocol        | Transport Layer          | Encryption        | Notes                                                                 |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **IPsec (IKEv1/IKEv2)** | Network Layer (IP)        | AES, 3DES          | Used for site-to-site and remote access VPNs. Secure and efficient.   |
| **OpenVPN**     | User Space (TCP/UDP)     | AES, ChaCha20     | Open source and highly configurable. Good for bypassing firewalls.    |
| **WireGuard**   | Network Layer (UDP)      | ChaCha20          | Modern, fast, lightweight, with a simpler codebase.                   |
| **SSL VPN**     | Application Layer (HTTPS)| TLS (AES, etc.)   | Enterprise remote access via browser or client. Firewall-friendly.    |
| **L2TP/IPsec**  | Layer 2 + Network Layer  | AES, 3DES         | L2TP handles tunneling; IPsec provides encryption. Legacy support.    |
| **PPTP**        | Tunneling (Layer 2)      | MPPE (128-bit)    | Fast but outdated and insecure. **Not recommended.**                  |
| **SSTP**        | SSL over TCP (443)       | TLS (AES, etc.)   | Developed by Microsoft. Native to Windows and firewall-friendly.      |
