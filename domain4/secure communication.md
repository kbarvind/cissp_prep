# üîê Securing VoIP Communication (CISSP Perspective)

To secure VoIP (Voice over IP) communication, CISSP candidates should understand both signaling and media stream protection, as well as supporting security controls.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Secure Signaling (Call Setup and Tear-down)

- **Use:** `SIPS` (Session Initiation Protocol Secure)
- **How:** SIP over TLS (Transport Layer Security)
- **Port:** TCP 5061
- **Protects against:** Spoofing, MITM attacks, and eavesdropping on signaling
- **Purpose:** Encrypts and authenticates signaling messages (e.g., call setup, registration)

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Secure Media Stream (Voice/Video)

- **Use:** `SRTP` (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol)
- **Function:** Encrypts and authenticates RTP voice/video packets
- **Security Benefits:**
  - Confidentiality
  - Integrity
  - Anti-replay protection
- **Encryption Used:** Typically AES

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Authentication and Authorization

- Use strong user authentication for VoIP devices (e.g., IP phones, soft clients)
- Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) between devices and SIP servers

---

## ‚úÖ 4. NAT Traversal and VPN

- Use VPNs (e.g., IPsec or SSL VPN) to secure VoIP across untrusted networks
- Protocols for NAT traversal:
  - STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT)
  - TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT)
  - ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment)

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Firewall and Intrusion Prevention

- Deploy VoIP-aware firewalls (supporting SIP ALG)
- Use Session Border Controllers (SBCs) to secure VoIP perimeter
- Implement IDS/IPS with VoIP-specific rules

---

## ‚úÖ 6. Network Segmentation and QoS

- Segment VoIP traffic using VLANs
- Apply Quality of Service (QoS) to prioritize VoIP packets
- Prevent DoS attacks with rate-limiting and traffic shaping

---

## ‚úÖ 7. Logging and Monitoring

- Monitor SIP logs and Call Detail Records (CDRs)
- Detect anomalies like:
  - Fraud
  - Toll abuse
  - Unusual call patterns

---

## ‚úÖ 8. Physical and Endpoint Security

- Physically secure VoIP endpoints
- Regularly patch and secure VoIP software and devices
- Use endpoint protection on softphones and VoIP servers
