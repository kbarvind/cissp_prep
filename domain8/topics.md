# CISSP Domain 8: Software Development Security

This domain focuses on securing the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and ensuring software is built, tested, and maintained securely.

---

## 1. Understand and Integrate Security in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

- **Security in SDLC models**: Apply security across Waterfall, Agile, DevOps, Spiral, etc.
- **Security activities in SDLC phases**:
  - **Requirements**: Define security requirements.
  - **Design**: Apply secure design principles (least privilege, defense in depth).
  - **Development**: Follow secure coding practices.
  - **Testing**: Conduct security tests (SAST, DAST, etc.).
  - **Deployment**: Ensure secure configuration and monitoring.
  - **Maintenance**: Manage patching and secure updates.

## 2. Identify and Apply Security Controls in Development Environments

- **Environment security**: Isolate and protect dev, test, staging, and prod environments.
- **Change management**: Approve and document changes securely.
- **Version control security**: Protect repositories and implement access control.
- **CI/CD pipeline security**: Secure build and deployment automation.

---

## 3. Assess the Effectiveness of Software Security

- **Security testing types**:
  - Static Analysis (SAST)
  - Dynamic Analysis (DAST)
  - Interactive Testing (IAST)
  - Manual Code Reviews
- **Penetration testing**: Simulate attacks to find vulnerabilities.
- **Software composition analysis**: Identify issues in third-party components.

## 4. Assess and Mitigate Software Vulnerabilities

- **Common vulnerabilities**:
  - Buffer overflows
  - Injection flaws (e.g., SQLi)
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - CSRF and insecure deserialization
- **Secure coding standards**: OWASP, SEI CERT, etc.
- **Use vulnerability databases**: CVE, CWE, NVD.
- **Patch and update management**: Ensure timely and secure updates.

---

## 5. Understand and Apply Secure Coding Guidelines and Standards

- **Coding frameworks and practices**:
  - OWASP Top 10
  - SANS Top 25
- **Best practices**:
  - Input validation
  - Output encoding
  - Error handling
  - Avoid hardcoded secrets
- **Code analysis tools**: Linters, static analyzers.

---

## 6. Understand Software Security and Privacy by Design

- **Design principles**:
  - Least privilege
  - Fail-safe defaults
  - Secure by default
- **Privacy by design**:
  - Data minimization
  - Consent and transparency
  - Secure deletion
- **Regulations**: Ensure compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, etc.

---

## 7. Understand the Security Impacts of Acquired Software

- **Third-party and open source risks**:
  - Evaluate and monitor external software.
- **Supply chain security**:
  - Verify code integrity and vendor reliability.
- **Contract/SLA review**:
  - Ensure security clauses are included in agreements.
