# SDLC Maturity Models

Understanding SDLC maturity models helps evaluate how well security is integrated into the software development lifecycle. These models guide organizations in improving their processes for higher efficiency and security.

## üîπ 1. Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)

CMMI is a process improvement framework that evaluates the maturity of development practices.

### Levels:

1. **Initial (Ad hoc/Chaotic)**  
   - Processes are unpredictable and poorly controlled.

2. **Managed**  
   - Basic project management practices are implemented and tracked.

3. **Defined**  
   - Standardized processes are established across the organization.

4. **Quantitatively Managed**  
   - Metrics and quantitative data are used to manage and control processes.

5. **Optimizing**  
   - Continuous process improvement through feedback and innovation.

**Use case**: Suitable for organizations looking to formalize and mature their development practices.

## üîπ 2. Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM)

BSIMM is a maturity model that measures the effectiveness of software security initiatives based on real-world data.

### Domains:

- **Governance**: Policies, compliance, and metrics.
- **Intelligence**: Threat modeling, security research, and knowledge sharing.
- **SSDL Touchpoints**: Code review, static/dynamic testing.
- **Deployment**: Environment hardening and secure configuration.

**Use case**: Ideal for benchmarking security efforts against industry peers.

## üîπ 3. Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)

SAMM, developed by OWASP, focuses on assessing and improving software security throughout the SDLC.

### Business Functions:

1. **Governance**
2. **Design**
3. **Implementation**
4. **Verification**
5. **Operations**

Each function contains 2 security practices, with **3 maturity levels**:

- **Level 1**: Ad hoc/basic
- **Level 2**: Defined/repeatable
- **Level 3**: Managed/measurable

**Use case**: Best for organizations seeking a structured and measurable way to improve security.

## üîπ 4. Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)

Microsoft SDL integrates security into each phase of development through a practical, prescriptive approach.

### Key Principles:

- **Security Training**: Developers are trained in secure development.
- **Security Requirements**: Defined during the planning phase.
- **Threat Modeling**: Identify and mitigate threats early.
- **Secure Coding**: Follow secure coding practices.
- **Security Testing**: Include both automated and manual tests.
- **Release and Response**: Conduct final security reviews and plan for incident response.

**Use case**: Best for teams implementing hands-on security in SDLC, especially in Microsoft environments.

## üîπ 5. NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)

NIST‚Äôs SSDF (SP 800-218) is a guideline focused on secure software development for government and critical infrastructure.

### Core Practice Groups:

1. **Prepare the Organization**
2. **Protect the Software**
3. **Produce Well-Secured Software**
4. **Respond to Vulnerabilities**

Each group includes tasks, examples, and references for implementation.

**Use case**: Ideal for regulatory compliance and high-security environments.
