1. Security Engineering Principles
	•	Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)
	•	Least Privilege – Users should have only the minimum access necessary.
	•	Defense in Depth – Layered security to mitigate risks.
	•	Fail-Safe Defaults – Deny by default; allow only when explicitly permitted.
	•	Economy of Mechanism – Simple, minimal design reduces vulnerabilities.
	•	Complete Mediation – Every access request must be checked.
	•	Open Design – Security should not depend on secrecy of design.
	•	Separation of Privilege – Multiple conditions should be required for sensitive operations.
	•	Least Common Mechanism – Minimize shared resources to reduce security risks.
	•	Psychological Acceptability – Security mechanisms should not be too complex for users.

2. Security Models and Concepts
	•	Bell-LaPadula Model (BLP) – Enforces confidentiality; “No Read Up, No Write Down.”
	•	Biba Model – Focuses on integrity; “No Write Up, No Read Down.”
	•	Clark-Wilson Model – Commercial model enforcing well-formed transactions.
	•	Brewer-Nash (Chinese Wall) Model – Prevents conflicts of interest.
	•	Graham-Denning Model – Defines rights for secure access control.
	•	Harrison-Ruzzo-Ullman Model – Access rights management.

3. Security Architecture and Frameworks
	•	Security Architecture Models:
		•	TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework)
		•	SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture)
		•	Zachman Framework
	•	Security Control Frameworks:
		•	NIST SP 800-53 – Security and privacy controls for U.S. government systems.
		•	ISO 27001/27002 – International standard for security controls.
		•	COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies) – IT governance framework.

4. System Security and Components
	•	Trusted Computing Base (TCB) – The core of a secure system, including hardware, software, and firmware.
		•	Security Kernel – The component that enforces security policy.
		•	Reference Monitor – A mechanism that controls access to objects.
	•	Hardware Security:
		•	TPM (Trusted Platform Module)
		•	HSM (Hardware Security Module)
	•	Operating System Security:
		•	Secure Boot
		•	Sandboxing
		•	Patch Management

5. Cryptography and Security Mechanisms
	•	Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption
	•	Cryptographic Hashing (SHA, MD5)
	•	Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
	•	Digital Signatures and Certificates
	•	SSL/TLS and IPSec

⸻

6. Cloud Security and Virtualization
	•	Cloud Security Models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
	•	Shared Responsibility Model
	•	Container Security (Docker, Kubernetes)
	•	Virtual Machine (VM) Security

⸻

7. Secure Design Principles for Network & Applications
	•	Firewalls, IDS/IPS, and Network Segmentation
	•	Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)
	•	Web Application Security (OWASP Top 10)
	•	Secure Coding Practices

8. Physical Security
	•	Perimeter Security (Locks, Guards, Biometrics)
	•	Environmental Controls (HVAC, Fire Suppression, Power Backup)
	•	TEMPEST Protection (Preventing Electromagnetic Eavesdropping)
