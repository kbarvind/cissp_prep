## 🔎 Types of Malware

### 1. 🦠 Virus
- Attaches to files or programs.
- Needs user action to spread.
- Damages files or system performance.
✅ Example: CIH (Chernobyl virus)

---

### 2. 🪱 Worm
- Self-replicates and spreads over networks.
- No user action needed.
- Can cause DDoS or spread payloads.
✅ Example: WannaCry

---

### 3. 🎭 Trojan Horse (Trojan)
- Masquerades as legitimate software.
- Opens backdoors or steals data.
✅ Example: Emotet

---

### 4. 🪙 Ransomware
- Encrypts files and demands ransom.
- Delivered via phishing or exploits.
✅ Example: CryptoLocker, Ryuk

---

### 5. 🕵️ Spyware
- Secretly records user activity.
- Steals passwords, keystrokes.
✅ Example: Keyloggers

---

### 6. 🎯 Adware
- Displays ads or redirects traffic.
- Often bundled with free software.
✅ Not always malicious, but invasive.

---

### 7. ⚙️ Rootkit
- Hides malware and tools.
- Operates at OS/kernel level.
- Hard to detect/remove.
✅ Example: Sony BMG Rootkit

---

### 8. 🔁 Backdoor
- Allows unauthorized remote access.
- Often installed by Trojans/worms.

---

### 9. 🧬 Fileless Malware
- Resides in system memory (RAM).
- Uses legitimate tools like PowerShell.
- Difficult to detect.
✅ Used in many APT attacks.

---

## 🛡️ Protection Strategies

- Regular updates and patching
- Antivirus and EDR solutions
- User awareness and phishing training
- Network segmentation
- Role-based access and least privilege
- Frequent secure backups

# 🦠 File Infector Virus vs. MBR Virus

| **Virus Type**        | **Description**                                                                 | **Trigger Point**                 | **Examples**                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **File Infector Virus**| Infects executable files (e.g., `.exe`, `.com`) and spreads when run.            | When an infected file is executed | CIH (Chernobyl), Jerusalem    |
| **MBR Virus**          | Infects the Master Boot Record of a disk. Executes before the OS loads.         | At system boot (before OS loads)  | Michelangelo, Stone virus     |

## 🔐 CISSP Relevance
- Covered in **Domain 7: Security Operations**
- Important in **malware analysis**, **incident response**, and **endpoint security**
