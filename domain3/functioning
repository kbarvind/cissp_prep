How Asymmetric Cryptosystem Works

How It Works:
	1.	Key Generation:
	   •	A user generates a public-private key pair (e.g., using RSA, ECC).
	2.	Encryption:
	   •	The sender encrypts a message using the recipient’s public key.
	3.	Decryption:
	   •	The recipient decrypts the message using their private key.
	4.	Digital Signatures (Optional):
        •	The sender can digitally sign a message using their private key to prove authenticity.
        •	The recipient verifies the signature using the sender’s public key.

Example - Secure Communication

📩 Alice sends an encrypted message to Bob
	•	Bob generates a public-private key pair.
	•	Alice encrypts her message using Bob’s public key.
	•	Bob decrypts the message using his private key.

✅ Benefit: Even if someone intercepts the message, they cannot decrypt it without Bob’s private key.

Example - Digital Signature

✍ Bob digitally signs a message to prove authenticity
	•	Bob hashes the message and encrypts the hash using his private key (digital signature).
	•	Alice receives the message + signature.
	•	Alice decrypts the signature using Bob’s public key and verifies it against the hash of the original message.

✅ Benefit: Ensures integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation.
