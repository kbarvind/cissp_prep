# Security Testing Types  

Security testing ensures that systems, applications, and networks remain secure against vulnerabilities. Below are different categories of security testing:

## 1. **Dynamic Testing**  
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)** – Scans web applications while running to detect vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.  
- **Fuzz Testing** – Sends random, malformed, or unexpected inputs to an application to trigger crashes or security flaws.  
- **Runtime Analysis** – Observes system behavior during execution to detect anomalies.  

## 2. **Static Testing**  
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** – Analyzes source code or binaries for vulnerabilities before execution.  
- **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)** – Identifies vulnerabilities in open-source components and third-party dependencies.  

## 3. **Interface Testing**  
- **API Security Testing** – Evaluates authentication, authorization, and input validation in APIs.  
- **Web Interface Testing** – Tests the security of web-based interfaces, such as login pages and session management.  
- **GUI Security Testing** – Ensures security in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to prevent UI-based attacks.  

## 4. **Network Security Testing**  
- **Firewall Rule Testing** – Validates firewall configurations to prevent unauthorized access.  
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS) Testing** – Checks whether security systems detect or block threats effectively.  
- **Wi-Fi Security Testing** – Evaluates wireless networks, encryption (WPA2, WPA3), and rogue access points.  

## 5. **Cloud Security Testing**  
- **Cloud Configuration Review** – Identifies misconfigurations in AWS, Azure, and GCP environments.  
- **Identity & Access Management (IAM) Testing** – Ensures proper role-based access control (RBAC) and permissions.  
- **Container Security Testing** – Scans Docker and Kubernetes environments for vulnerabilities.  

## 6. **Penetration Testing (Ethical Hacking)**  
- **Black Box Testing** – Simulates an external attacker with no prior system knowledge.  
- **White Box Testing** – Involves full system access to analyze security flaws.  
- **Gray Box Testing** – Uses limited knowledge, simulating an internal attack scenario.  

## 7. **Red Team vs. Blue Team Testing**  
- **Red Team Testing** – Offensive security team simulates real-world cyberattacks.  
- **Blue Team Testing** – Defensive team monitors, detects, and responds to threats.  
- **Purple Team Testing** – Collaborative approach where Red and Blue teams work together to improve security.  

## 8. **Social Engineering Testing**  
- **Phishing Simulation** – Tests employee awareness by sending fake phishing emails.  
- **Pretexting Attacks** – Uses social manipulation to extract sensitive information.  
- **USB Drop Testing** – Leaves malicious USB devices in an organization to test curiosity-driven security risks.  

## 9. **Compliance & Regulatory Testing**  
- **PCI-DSS Security Testing** – Ensures credit card transaction security compliance.  
- **HIPAA Security Testing** – Validates healthcare data protection measures.  
- **GDPR Compliance Testing** – Assesses data privacy controls for personal information.  

## 10. **Physical Security Testing**  
- **Tailgating Tests** – Evaluates unauthorized access into restricted areas.  
- **Badge Cloning** – Tests security vulnerabilities in RFID access cards.  
- **Lock Picking & Bypass Tests** – Checks the security of physical locks and entry points.  

## 11. **Incident Response & Forensic Testing**  
- **Tabletop Exercises** – Simulated cybersecurity incident response drills.  
- **Digital Forensics Testing** – Investigates security incidents and data breaches.  
- **Threat Hunting** – Proactively searches for hidden threats within the network.  

## 12. **IoT & Embedded System Security Testing**  
- **IoT Device Security Testing** – Identifies security flaws in smart home and industrial IoT devices.  
- **Firmware Security Testing** – Analyzes firmware for vulnerabilities in embedded systems.  
- **Side-Channel Attack Testing** – Assesses the risk of hardware-based attacks like power analysis and timing attacks.  

## 13. **Zero Trust Security Testing**  
- **Access Control Validation** – Ensures least-privilege access policies are enforced.  
- **Micro-Segmentation Testing** – Verifies that network segmentation limits lateral movement.  
- **Continuous Authentication Testing** – Tests adaptive authentication mechanisms.  

## 14. **Mobile Security Testing**  
- **Android & iOS Application Testing** – Analyzes mobile apps for security vulnerabilities.  
- **Mobile Device Management (MDM) Security Testing** – Ensures secure policies for enterprise mobile devices.  
- **Reverse Engineering Testing** – Identifies security flaws in mobile app binaries.  

## 15. **AI & Machine Learning Security Testing**  
- **Adversarial ML Testing** – Evaluates AI models against data poisoning and evasion attacks.  
- **Bias & Privacy Testing** – Ensures AI systems handle data securely and fairly.  
- **Model Extraction Attacks** – Assesses risks of an attacker reconstructing a proprietary AI model.
