## Types of Penetration Testing and Risks Uncovered

| **Category** | **Penetration Testing Type** | **Description** | **Risks Uncovered** |
|-------------|-----------------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Based on Knowledge Level** | **Black-box Testing** | No prior knowledge of the system, simulates external attacker | External attack surface vulnerabilities, authentication bypass |
|  | **White-box Testing** | Full knowledge of system architecture and source code | Business logic flaws, insecure code, insider threats |
|  | **Gray-box Testing** | Limited knowledge, mimics an attacker with some access | Privilege escalation, session management flaws |
| **Based on Target Scope** | **Network Penetration Testing** | Tests internal and external networks | Open ports, misconfigurations, weak encryption |
|  | **Web Application Penetration Testing** | Assesses web applications | SQL injection, XSS, authentication flaws |
|  | **Mobile Application Penetration Testing** | Tests mobile apps on iOS and Android | Insecure data storage, weak API security |
|  | **Wireless Penetration Testing** | Evaluates Wi-Fi security | Weak encryption, rogue access points |
|  | **Cloud Penetration Testing** | Identifies cloud misconfigurations | Exposed storage, IAM policy weaknesses |
|  | **IoT Penetration Testing** | Assesses IoT device security | Default credentials, firmware vulnerabilities |
|  | **Physical Penetration Testing** | Tests physical security controls | Unauthorized access, social engineering |
| **Based on Objective** | **External Penetration Testing** | Simulates attacks from outside the network | DDoS vulnerabilities, exposed services |
|  | **Internal Penetration Testing** | Simulates an insider threat | Privilege escalation, unauthorized access |
|  | **Blind Penetration Testing** | The tester has no prior knowledge | Realistic attack simulation, response time analysis |
|  | **Double-Blind Penetration Testing** | Neither tester nor security team is aware | Evaluates incident response effectiveness |
|  | **Targeted Penetration Testing** | Security team and tester work together | Focused vulnerability detection, in-depth analysis |
