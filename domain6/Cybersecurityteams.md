# Cybersecurity Teams in an Organization

Organizations use specialized security teams to enhance their cybersecurity posture. Each team plays a distinct role in protecting digital assets from threats.

## **1. Red Team (Offensive Security)**
- **Objective**: Simulate real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Tasks**:
  - Conduct **penetration testing** (ethical hacking).
  - Use **social engineering** techniques to exploit human weaknesses.
  - Test **physical security** (e.g., badge cloning, tailgating).
  - Simulate **Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)**.
  - Assess **network, application, and endpoint security**.
- **Key Tools**: Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, Kali Linux, BloodHound.

## **2. Blue Team (Defensive Security)**
- **Objective**: Detect, respond to, and mitigate security threats.
- **Tasks**:
  - Monitor **logs and network traffic** for anomalies.
  - Deploy **Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**.
  - Conduct **incident response and digital forensics**.
  - Implement **security patches and risk mitigation strategies**.
  - Improve **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** effectiveness.
- **Key Tools**: Splunk, ELK Stack, Wireshark, Snort, OSSEC.

## **3. Purple Team (Collaboration between Red & Blue Teams)**
- **Objective**: Bridge the gap between Red and Blue teams to improve security strategies.
- **Tasks**:
  - Share attack insights from **Red Team** to enhance defense mechanisms.
  - Assist in **developing real-world incident response strategies**.
  - Test **new security policies** and ensure they counter real-world attack techniques.
- **Key Tools**: MITRE ATT&CK Framework, Atomic Red Team, PurpleSharp.

## **4. Green Team (Security Engineers & Developers)**
- **Objective**: Fix security issues found by Red and Blue teams.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement **secure coding practices**.
  - Patch vulnerabilities identified during **pen testing**.
  - Enforce **secure software development lifecycle (SDLC)**.
  - Enhance **system hardening & security configurations**.
- **Key Tools**: SAST & DAST tools like SonarQube, Checkmarx, OWASP ZAP.

## **5. Yellow Team (Security Awareness & Training)**
- **Objective**: Educate employees on security best practices.
- **Tasks**:
  - Conduct **phishing simulations & social engineering awareness**.
  - Train employees on **security policies & procedures**.
  - Develop **secure behavior culture** within the organization.
- **Key Tools**: KnowBe4, Cofense, PhishMe.

## **6. White Team (Compliance & Auditors)**
- **Objective**: Ensure adherence to compliance, governance, and risk management.
- **Tasks**:
  - Perform **security audits & compliance assessments** (ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, NIST).
  - Define **cybersecurity policies & risk management frameworks**.
  - Ensure **regulatory requirements** are met (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- **Key Tools**: Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys.
