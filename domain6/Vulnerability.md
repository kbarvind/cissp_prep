# Security Testing and Evaluation Techniques

## 1. Vulnerability Assessments
- **Types of Vulnerabilities**
  - Misconfigurations (e.g., weak encryption, open ports)
  - Outdated software (unpatched systems)
  - Weak authentication and authorization mechanisms
  - Known software vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs, OWASP Top 10)
- **Assessment Process**
  - Asset Identification → Identify systems & components to assess
  - Scanning → Use automated tools (Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys)
  - Analysis → Evaluate impact & risk
  - Remediation → Prioritize & fix vulnerabilities
- **Common Tools**: Nessus, Qualys, OpenVAS, Burp Suite, Nmap

## 2. Penetration Testing (Black-box, White-box, Gray-box)
- **Types of Penetration Testing**:
  - **Black-box**: No prior knowledge, simulates external attack
  - **White-box**: Full knowledge, deep security flaws analysis
  - **Gray-box**: Partial knowledge, authenticated user attack
- **Pentesting Stages (PTES Framework)**:
  1. Planning & Reconnaissance
  2. Scanning & Enumeration
  3. Exploitation
  4. Privilege Escalation
  5. Post-Exploitation
  6. Reporting & Remediation
- **Common Tools**: Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, SQLMap

## 3. Log Reviews and Security Monitoring
- **Types of Logs**:
  - System Logs (Windows Event Logs, syslog)
  - Application Logs (Apache, database logs)
  - Security Logs (Firewall, IDS/IPS, SIEM logs)
  - Network Logs (NetFlow, packet captures)
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**
  - Correlates log data from multiple sources
  - Detects anomalies and potential security threats
  - Example SIEM tools: Splunk, ELK Stack, IBM QRadar
- **Log Review Best Practices**
  - Enable centralized logging to detect patterns
  - Use automated log correlation (SIEM)
  - Set alerts for critical events
  - Retain logs per compliance requirements

## 4. Code Review (Static & Dynamic Analysis)
- **Types of Code Analysis**:
  - **Static Analysis (SAST)**: Examines source code without execution
  - **Dynamic Analysis (DAST)**: Tests application while running
  - **Interactive Analysis (IAST)**: Combines SAST & DAST
- **Secure Code Review Best Practices**:
  - Use peer reviews and automated scanners
  - Follow secure coding guidelines (OWASP, NIST, CIS)
  - Enforce input validation and secure authentication
  - Perform regular reviews & threat modeling

## 5. Risk-based Testing Approaches
- **Why Risk-based Testing?**
  - Not all security risks are equal
  - Focuses resources on critical vulnerabilities
  - Aligns with business impact analysis (BIA)
- **Risk Factors for Prioritization**:
  - Asset criticality (high-value assets)
  - Attack likelihood (public-facing, frequently targeted)
  - Compliance & regulatory requirements (PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)
  - Known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE, OWASP Top 10, MITRE ATT&CK)
- **Risk-based Testing Workflow**:
  1. Identify Critical Assets
  2. Assess Threats & Vulnerabilities
  3. Determine Impact & Likelihood
  4. Prioritize Testing Based on Risk
  5. Mitigate & Monitor Risks Continuously

## Choosing the Right Tool Based on Use Case

| **Use Case** | **Recommended Tool(s)** |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Network vulnerability scanning** | Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys |
| **Web application security** | Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Nikto |
| **Endpoint vulnerability management** | Microsoft Defender, Rapid7 Nexpose |
| **Cloud vulnerability scanning** | Tenable.io, Qualys |
| **Compliance auditing (PCI DSS, HIPAA, ISO 27001)** | Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7 Nexpose |
| **Penetration testing & exploitation** | Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nikto |

## Different Risks Uncovered by Vulnerability Assessment Tools

| **Risk Type** | **Description** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Network Vulnerabilities** | Open ports, misconfigured services, outdated protocols |
| **Application Security Risks** | SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), insecure authentication |
| **System Misconfigurations** | Default credentials, weak permissions, outdated software |
| **Cloud Security Issues** | Misconfigured storage, overly permissive IAM policies, unencrypted data |
| **Endpoint Security Risks** | Unpatched OS, insecure applications, malware infections |
| **Compliance Violations** | Non-adherence to PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, and ISO 27001 |
| **Data Leakage** | Exposure of sensitive data through logs, misconfigurations, or weak encryption |
| **Access Control Weaknesses** | Excessive user permissions, lack of MFA, privilege escalation vulnerabilities |
| **Zero-Day Exploits** | Emerging threats not covered by traditional signature-based tools |


## Vulnerability Assessment Tools, Functions, and Risks Uncovered

| **Tool** | **Function** | **Risks Uncovered** |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| **Nessus** | Network vulnerability scanning | Open ports, outdated software, misconfigurations |
| **OpenVAS** | Comprehensive security scanning | System misconfigurations, network vulnerabilities |
| **Qualys** | Cloud-based vulnerability management | Compliance violations, cloud security misconfigurations |
| **Burp Suite** | Web application security testing | SQL injection, XSS, authentication flaws |
| **OWASP ZAP** | Web application scanning | Insecure APIs, authentication flaws, injection attacks |
| **Metasploit** | Penetration testing & exploit development | Exploitable vulnerabilities, privilege escalation risks |
| **Nikto** | Web server scanning | Outdated server software, security misconfigurations |
| **Rapid7 Nexpose** | Risk-based vulnerability management | Endpoint security risks, compliance issues |
| **Tenable.io** | Cloud security scanning | Cloud misconfigurations, access control issues |
| **Microsoft Defender** | Endpoint protection and vulnerability assessment | Malware infections, unpatched systems |

## Key Differences Between Nmap and MBSA

| **Feature**    | **Nmap** | **MBSA** |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| **Function**  | Network scanning and security auditing | Windows system security assessment |
| **Scope**     | Network-wide (Linux, Windows, IoT, etc.) | Windows-only security checks |
| **Usage**     | Port scanning, service detection, vulnerability scanning | Checking missing patches, misconfigurations, and system security |
| **Best for**  | Ethical hacking, penetration testing, network security | Compliance checks, Windows system hardening |
| **Output**    | Lists open ports, running services, OS detection, and vulnerabilities | Generates a report on missing updates, weak configurations, and system security gaps |
| **Current Status** | Actively maintained | Deprecated (Replaced by Microsoft security tools) |

### Summary:
- **Nmap**: Ideal for **network penetration testing** and **security auditing**.
- **MBSA**: Used for **Windows security assessment**, but it is **deprecated**—consider **Microsoft Defender or SCCM for compliance checks**.

# SAST, DAST and IAST

## Difference Between SAST, DAST, and IAST

| **Aspect** | **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)** | **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)** | **IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing)** |
|------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Testing Approach** | Analyzes source code, bytecode, or binaries without executing the application | Tests the application in a running state (black-box testing) | Combines elements of both SAST and DAST, monitoring runtime behavior |
| **Stage of Testing** | Conducted early in development (pre-production) | Conducted during runtime (post-deployment or late-stage testing) | Performed during application execution, often in QA or production-like environments |
| **Code Knowledge Required?** | Requires access to source code | No access to source code required | Works with running applications, integrating within the code |
| **Accuracy** | High false positives | Higher false negatives | Lower false positives and negatives |
| **Tools** | SonarQube, Checkmarx, Veracode | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Acunetix | Hdiv Security, Contrast Security |
