# Log Reviews and Security Monitoring in Domain 6 of CISSP

## **1. Log Reviews**
Log review involves systematically analyzing logs generated by systems, applications, and network devices to identify anomalies, security events, or compliance violations.

### **Types of Logs Reviewed**
1. **System Logs** – OS-level logs (Windows Event Viewer, Linux Syslogs)
2. **Application Logs** – Logs from web servers, databases, and business applications
3. **Security Logs** – Logs from IDS/IPS, firewalls, and antivirus tools
4. **Authentication Logs** – Tracks login attempts, failed logins, and account lockouts
5. **Network Logs** – Captures network traffic, firewall rules, and DNS queries
6. **Audit Logs** – Records changes in configurations, access control modifications
7. **Transaction Logs** – Logs from databases showing queries, inserts, updates, and deletes

### **Key Security Issues Identified in Log Reviews**
- Unauthorized access attempts  
- Privilege escalation activities  
- Malware infections or abnormal system behavior  
- Data exfiltration attempts  
- Configuration changes in security devices  
- Insider threats (e.g., unusual login patterns)  
- Compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)

## **2. Security Monitoring**
Security monitoring is the continuous collection and analysis of logs, alerts, and system activities to detect and respond to security threats in real-time.

### **Key Components of Security Monitoring**
1. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**  
   - Aggregates and correlates log data from multiple sources  
   - Detects security threats and generates alerts (e.g., Splunk, QRadar, ArcSight)  
2. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**  
   - Identifies malicious network activities  
   - IDS: Detects threats but doesn’t block them  
   - IPS: Detects and actively blocks threats  
3. **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**  
   - Monitors endpoints for malware, unauthorized access, or data breaches  
4. **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)**  
   - Uses AI/ML to detect anomalies in user behavior (e.g., unusual login times, excessive file access)  
5. **Network Traffic Analysis (NTA)**  
   - Monitors data packets for unusual patterns or potential attacks  
6. **Threat Intelligence Feeds**  
   - Uses global threat data to identify emerging attack techniques  

### **Common Security Monitoring Challenges**
- **High volume of alerts** – SIEM and IDS/IPS generate a large number of logs, leading to alert fatigue.  
- **False positives** – Security tools may trigger unnecessary alerts, requiring manual validation.  
- **Insider threats** – Some threats may come from trusted users, making them harder to detect.  
- **Lack of log retention** – Retaining logs for compliance (e.g., PCI-DSS requires 1-year log retention).  



## Continuous Monitoring and Risk Indicators**

### **What is Continuous Monitoring?**
Continuous monitoring is the ongoing process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating security risks in an IT environment. It ensures real-time awareness of threats and compliance with security policies.

### **Key Aspects of Continuous Monitoring:**
1. **Automated Threat Detection** – Identifying vulnerabilities through tools like SIEM, IDS/IPS, and EDR.
2. **Risk-Based Approach** – Prioritizing security threats based on their potential impact.
3. **Compliance Monitoring** – Ensuring adherence to security policies, regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, NIST 800-53).
4. **Anomaly Detection** – Detecting abnormal patterns in user behavior, network traffic, and system logs.
5. **Real-time Incident Response** – Automating alerts and actions for rapid mitigation of security events.

### **Risk Indicators in Continuous Monitoring:**
- **Unauthorized Access Attempts** – Multiple failed logins, unusual login times.
- **Abnormal Data Transfers** – Large data transfers indicating potential data exfiltration.
- **Configuration Changes** – Unexpected modifications to security settings.
- **Inconsistent User Behavior** – Employees accessing sensitive files outside working hours.
- **Excessive Privilege Use** – Users executing commands beyond their roles.

## Performance Tracking and Reporting**

### **What is Performance Tracking in Security?**
Performance tracking in cybersecurity involves measuring the effectiveness of security controls, incident response times, and compliance with security policies.

### **Key Metrics for Security Performance Tracking:**
1. **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)** – The average time taken to identify security incidents.
2. **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)** – The time required to mitigate or resolve security threats.
3. **False Positive Rate** – Percentage of incorrect alerts generated by security tools.
4. **Patch Management Effectiveness** – Tracking the time taken to apply security patches.
5. **Compliance Score** – Measuring adherence to security frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, PCI-DSS).

### **Security Reporting Best Practices:**
1. **Use Dashboards** – Visualize security metrics with SIEM tools (e.g., Splunk, ELK Stack).
2. **Automate Reports** – Generate periodic security reports for management and audits.
3. **Incident Summaries** – Document key security incidents, their impact, and response actions.
4. **Threat Trend Analysis** – Identify emerging threats and adjust security strategies accordingly.
5. **Stakeholder Communication** – Tailor reports for technical teams, executives, and compliance officers.
