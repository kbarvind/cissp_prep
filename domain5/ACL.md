## Capability Table

A capability table is a security mechanism used in computer systems to define the access rights of subjects (such as users or processes) to objects (such as files, devices, or other resources). It is a matrix that specifies the permissions each subject has for each object, effectively controlling what actions can be performed.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Subject-Object Relationship**: The table maps subjects to objects, detailing the specific operations that subjects can perform on objects.
  
- **Access Rights**: Each entry in the table specifies the access rights (e.g., read, write, execute) that a subject has for a particular object.

- **Decentralized Control**: Capability tables can be used to implement decentralized access control, where each subject holds its own set of capabilities, reducing the need for a central authority to manage permissions.

- **Security**: By explicitly defining access rights, capability tables help prevent unauthorized access and ensure that subjects can only perform actions they are permitted to.

### Example:

Consider a system with two users, Alice and Bob, and two files, File1 and File2. A capability table might look like this:

| Subject | Object | Access Rights   |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Alice   | File1  | Read, Write     |
| Alice   | File2  | Read            |
| Bob     | File1  | Read            |
| Bob     | File2  | Read, Write     |

In this example, Alice can read and write to File1 but only read File2, while Bob can read File1 and both read and write to File2.

### Benefits:

- **Flexibility**: Capability tables allow for fine-grained access control, enabling specific permissions to be assigned to different subjects.
  
- **Efficiency**: They can be more efficient than traditional access control lists (ACLs) in certain scenarios, as they focus on the capabilities of subjects rather than the permissions of objects.

- **Security**: By clearly defining what actions are permissible, capability tables help mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.

Capability tables are an essential concept in the field of computer security, particularly in systems that require robust and flexible access control mechanisms.
