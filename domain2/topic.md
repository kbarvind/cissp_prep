# CISSP Domain 2: Asset Security

## 1. Data Classification
- **Definition**: Categorizing data based on sensitivity and importance.
- **Purpose**: Ensures appropriate security controls are applied.
- **Classification Types**:
  - **Government**: Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, Unclassified.
  - **Commercial**: Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted.
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Data should be labeled appropriately.
  - Access should be restricted based on classification.
  - Periodic reviews and reclassification are necessary.

## 2. Data Ownership & Roles
- **Data Owner**: Defines classification & security policies.
- **Data Custodian**: Implements security controls, manages backups.
- **Data User**: Uses data while adhering to policies.
- **Data Processor**: Third-party handling data on behalf of an organization.
- **Key Principle**: "Need to know" and "Least Privilege".

## 3. Data Protection Methods
- **Encryption**:
  - Secures data at rest, in transit, and in use.
  - Common algorithms: AES, RSA, ECC.
- **Tokenization & Masking**:
  - Tokenization replaces sensitive data with tokens.
  - Masking obscures parts of data (e.g., credit card masking).
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**:
  - Prevents unauthorized data transfer (USB, cloud, email, etc.).
- **Access Control Models**:
  - **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control): Access based on roles.
  - **MAC** (Mandatory Access Control): Strict classifications.
  - **DAC** (Discretionary Access Control): Data owners decide access.

## 4. Data Retention & Disposal
- **Retention Policies**:
  - Defines how long data must be stored based on regulations and business needs.
- **Secure Disposal Methods**:
  - **Physical**: Shredding, degaussing, incineration.
  - **Logical**: Secure erase, cryptographic erase, overwriting.
  - **Legal Compliance**: GDPR "Right to be Forgotten".

## 5. Data Handling & Storage
- **Labeling & Marking**:
  - Clearly indicate data sensitivity (e.g., "Confidential").
- **Secure Storage**:
  - Encrypted storage, access control policies, physical security.
- **Secure Data Transfer**:
  - Encryption (TLS, VPNs), secure file sharing.
  - Use hashing for integrity verification.

## 6. Privacy Protection & Compliance
- **Privacy Regulations**:
  - **GDPR** (EU): Personal data rights, consent requirements.
  - **CCPA** (California): Consumer data protection.
  - **HIPAA** (Healthcare): Protects medical data.
  - **PCI DSS** (Payment Cards): Security for credit card transactions.
- **Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)**:
  - Evaluates risks in data handling.
  - Ensures compliance with privacy laws.

## 7. Security Controls & Auditing
- **Access Reviews**:
  - Regularly review and adjust access permissions.
- **Security Audits**:
  - Internal & external assessments of security controls.
  - Compliance with standards like ISO 27001.
- **Continuous Monitoring**:
  - Logging, SIEM solutions, anomaly detection.
  - Automated alerts for suspicious activity.
